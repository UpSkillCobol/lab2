This file is a tutorial which explains all the procedures for the installing of the application.
</br>
</br>

#### STEPS:
</br>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the folder by clicking this [link](https://github.com/UpSkillCobol/lab2/blob/main/Part3/source/Breadwich%20V3.1%20FINAL%20VERSION.7z).
</br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract all files to another folder in your own computer.
</br>

3Ô∏è‚É£ There's an icone with the name "**COMPILE ALL NECESSARY FILES**" which is going to create one file with the extension of **.exe** and all the other files with the extension of **.dll**.
</br>

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the program with **BREADWICH.exe**.
</br>

5Ô∏è‚É£ To change your entire application from English to Portuguese and vice versa, you need to go to the **Constants folder** and choose the language you want by entering the subfolder. Then you should copy all the files with the extension **.cpy** and place them directly in the main folder, replacing the files.
</br>

6Ô∏è‚É£ Enjoy your application as much as we do.
</br>

7Ô∏è‚É£ Don't hesitate to ask support anytime you need. ‚ùì
